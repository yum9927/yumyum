After attending college and working only as a composer, his full-fledged career as a singer began in 2014. The Other, the debut song, is a song that melts the feelings after the breakup, and it is a mixture of R&B and indie pop. When the song was released, music bloggers drew attention and entered the Spotify Global Top 100. In 2015, they released their debut EP "Lost In The Light" and single "Question" (feat. Travis Mills).<br>
After that, he took a break from singing and focused on his role as a composer. Representative songs released at this time include Cheat Codes and Demi Lovato's "No Promises" and Charlie XCX's "Boys."<br>
On May 19, 2017, she released her single I Like Me Better, signaling her career as a singer again. In the same year, he toured eight U.S. cities and performed at the Music Festival Summerfest in Milwaukee.<br>
In September 2017, it was officially announced that Ed Sheeran would participate in the division Asian tour. In the aftermath of Ed Sheeran's injury, performances in Manila and Jakarta were postponed or canceled, but Lauv performed alone on his original schedule and later met Ed Sheeran.<br>
He later released the album "I met you when I was 18." (the playlist) and held a world tour.
