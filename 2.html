<h2>Steal The Show</h2>
<p>
Started out on a one way train<br>
Always knew where I was gonna go next<br>
Didn't know until I saw your face<br>
I was missin' out on every moment<br>
You'll be one and baby I'll be two<br>
Would you mind it if I said I'm into you?<br>
(I'm into you)<br>
So if it's real<br>
Then darlin' let me know<br>
I wouldn't mind<br>
If you steal the show<br>
You and I we go together<br>
You're the sky I'll be the weather<br>
A pretty thing, the sun and rain<br>
Who knew<br>
Oooh, yeah<br>
Summer night, perfect occasion<br>
Where am I<br>
You know I'll be waiting for you<br>
Ooh, for you<br>
So if it's real<br>
Then darlin' let me know<br>
I wouldn't mind<br>
If you steal the show<br>
So if it's real<br>
Then darling let me know<br>
I wouldn't mind<br>
If you steal the show<br>
You shine<br>
You shine<br>
Like forever lasts forever<br>
You shine<br>
You shine<br>
And steal the show<br>
So if it's real<br>
Then darlin' let me know<br>
I wouldn't mind<br>
If you steal the show (started out on a one way train)<br>
(Always knew where I was gonna go next)<br>
So if it's real (didn't know until I saw your face)<br>
Then darlin' let me know (I was missing out on every moment)<br>
(You'll be one and baby I'll be two)<br>
(Would you mind it if I said I'm into you?)<br>
I wouldn't mind<br>
If you steal the show<br>
